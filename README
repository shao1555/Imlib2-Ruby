Introduction
============
Imlib2-Ruby is a Ruby interface to Imlib2.  All of Imlib2 (except for
X11 calls) has been wrapped.  I've provided a my test script and handful
of commented scripts in examples/, and there's an rdoc-generated API
reference in doc/ (which you can rebuild yourself by typing "rdoc
./imlib2.c").  Imlib2-Ruby is also available in the FreeBSD ports
collection (courtesy of Akinori Musha), as a NetBSD package (courtesy of 
Obata Akio), in Debian Linux via apt-get (courtesy of Jon Bernard), and
as a RubyGem (courtesy of Chad Fowler).  Imlib2-Ruby is still a work in
progress, so bug reports or patches are welcome.  Feel free to email me
at the address below if you have any additional questions.
